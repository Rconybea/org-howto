* Introduction
  Want ability to control cpu speed to allow meaningful performance testing.

** sources
   ~org-mode~ source is here: file:ubuntu-cpu-speed-src.org

* Prerequisites
  #+begin_example
  sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils
  #+end_example

* Monitoring Commands

** view available setters
   #+begin_example
   sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors
   #+end_example
   I see this output:
   #+begin_example
   performance powersave
   #+end_example

** view current scaling state
   #+begin_example
   sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
   #+end_example
   I typically see this output:
   #+begin_example
   powersave
   #+end_example

** view current cpu state
   #+begin_example
   cpufreq-info
   #+end_example
   output like this (cpus 1..6 removed for brevity):
   #+begin_example

   Report errors and bugs to cpufreq@vger.kernel.org, please.
   analyzing CPU 0:
     driver: intel_pstate
     CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
     CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
     maximum transition latency: 0.97 ms.
     hardware limits: 800 MHz - 3.50 GHz
     available cpufreq governors: performance, powersave
     current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 3.50 GHz.
		     The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
		     within this range.
     current CPU frequency is 2.30 GHz.
   ...
   analyzing CPU 7:
     driver: intel_pstate
     CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 7
     CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 7
     maximum transition latency: 0.97 ms.
     hardware limits: 800 MHz - 3.50 GHz
     available cpufreq governors: performance, powersave
     current policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 3.50 GHz.
		     The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
		     within this range.
     current CPU frequency is 2.57 GHz.

* Mode-Setting Commands

** to choose performance mode  
   #+begin_example
   sudo echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
   #+end_example

** to restore powersave mode
   #+begin_example
   sudo echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
   #+end_example
